# Hello World!

# Hi I'm Marianne ðŸ‘‹

Currentely I'm intern at Globo working with large applications using Golag and Python on backend, and Javascript with React.js on frontend. I delivered some features that are on prod with units tests. 

From 2020 to sept/2022 I worked as support engineer, in Ruby on Rails enviroment, debubbing stuff on prod when reciving demands from clientes. Produced tailored reports to raise customer satisfaction using ORM and SQL tools in a relational database.
